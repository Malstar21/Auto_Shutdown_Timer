# Auto Shutdown Timer

A simple windows application that allows users to input a timer and action that will either shut down/restart/sleep a windows 
machine once the timer reaches zero.

Why stay up late waiting for that 1 hour download when you can simply set the timer to shut down your machine for you while 
you save that hour of sleep. Of course this works for any amount of time you set it to. 

I do not recommend setting the timer to excalty that of the estimated download time. I give myself usually an extra 10-30 minutes just 
to be certain that my download finishes.
